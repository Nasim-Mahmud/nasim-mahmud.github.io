      <b class="underline">Description:</b>
      At the NSU Intelligent Robotics Lab, we are developing the NIRO
      EDUCATIONAL Bot to facilitate research and provide students with hands-on
      robotics learning. This robot features built-in elements such as a
      gyroscope, IR sensors, motors, and WiFi, and combines Raspberry Pi and
      Arduino for processing, while allowing users to add hardware like LiDAR
      and depth cameras. Its custom 3D-printed design and PCB, along with a
      differential drive system, make it highly adaptable to different user
      requirements.

      <b class="underline">Description:</b>
      Wheeled robots work well on smooth, flat surfaces but face challenges on
      rough, uneven terrain, limiting their effectiveness in rescue and
      exploration missions. Hexapod robots, with six legs each having 3 degrees
      of freedom, offer greater stability and adaptability in complex
      environments by distributing weight and navigating obstacles more
      effectively. Our hexapod is powered by 18 high-torque bus servo motors for
      precise leg movement, fueled by a LiPo battery for extended operation, and
      controlled by an Arduino microcontroller for real-time processing. It is
      also designed modularly to support the addition of advanced components
      like Raspberry Pi, Lidar, and depth sensors, enhancing its autonomous
      exploration and environmental mapping capabilities.
